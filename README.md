# Websites 

This website will allow you to construct a map of citations for a paper given it's bibcode. It is currently only hosted locally using flask for python. This project uses Leaflet (http://leafletjs.com/) to display the map data. 

To do:
- host on heroku
- cache locations
- improve geocoding function 
- code optimization of ADS scraping
- error handling for first author institutions for which the geocode is not found.
